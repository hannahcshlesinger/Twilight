## Introduction

Since its publication in 2005, *The Twilight Saga* many have praised and disparaged the romance between high schooler Bella and her swoony Vampire boyfriend Edward. Over time, the book series and movie franchise has been criticized for its many flaws, namely the unhealthy relationship between Edward and Bella, and general misogyny, sexism, and racism. Yet, despite its flaws, many readers think of the series with a degree of fondness. While it would be a worthy endeavor to take any one of its flaws and blow it up for examination, I am not going to be directing my focus on its flaws. Instead, I am interested in unpacking exactly how *Twilight* connects and resonates with its readers. 

One theory discussed in the study of Young Adult Literature scholarship is the notion of narrative intimacy between young adolescent readers and narrators. In her book *Reading Like a Girl: Narrative Intimacy in Contemporary Young Adult Literature,* Sara K. Day describes narrative intimacy as "a desire on the part of many adolescent women readers to identify so strongly with characters that the line between fictional story and real reading experience can be blurred or disregarded entirely" (3). Day breaks down the typical methods authors use to establish this intimacy between their narrators and intended readers. She emphasizes the importance of writing in first person perspective and present tense to create a sense immediacy and full reader immersion into the text. Furthermore, narrators will often disclose their deepest secrets and confessions to their readers, sharing their feelings with the reader before they confessing them to any other characters in the novel (4). This is executed most directly in epistolary form or novels that incorporate some sort of diary fiction. 

*The Twilight Saga* practices a few of these methods like narrating the story in first person point of view. Yet, how exactly can one quantify and calculate more abstract moments of narrative intimacy between Bella and her readers? Using computational methods, I will attempt to quantify and compute the moments of intimacy in *The Twilight Saga.* Specifically, I will be looking at the emotional and physical language in order to see how emotional each novel is and how these emotions are being described in different contexts.
